            <p><strong> Straight Felling- </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Felling is the process of cutting down a tree and is 
                more commonly known as Tree removal. This includes 
                removing all branches, logs and bushwood. 
                Straight felling is when a tree is cut from the base and
                allowed to fall to the ground in a controlled manner.</p>

            <p><strong> Section Tree Felling- </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Section tree felling is when a tree is cut down in more manageable sections.
                This process involves cutting off all tree branches first, lowering all large limbs 
                using ropes and then removing the trunk in sections that can be dropped onto 
                a suitable landing zone. This process is needed for limited spaces to avoid any 
                damage. </p>

            <p><strong> Pollarding- </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Pollarding is a method of tree management where the main leading stem of a young
                tree is removed to encourage regrowth. The regrowth that then occurs can be 
                regularly removed back to the same point.</p>

            <p><strong> Stump Grinding- </strong>
                <br>
                <br>
                Tree stump removal is a process where the stump is removed. This can be done
                either by using hand tools or we can use mechanical machinery such as a stump
                grinder to grind out the tree stump.

                <br>
                <br>
                This is the process of keeping a tree in good shape or to prevent it
                from getting too large for a space. Thinning involves selecting and 
                removing a proportion of the branches to allow more light through.</p>
