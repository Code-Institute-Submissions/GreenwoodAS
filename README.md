- The Navigation bar is fully responsive and identical on all three pages this helps give the site a common theme.

- The company logo is also part of the navigation bar, this also acts as a link back to the home page.

- The home page has multiple sections, so the navigation bar has links to the 'About Us' and 'Gallery' sections on the home page to make them easier to find.

### Meet The Team Section

- This section is especially important for making customers feel comfortable inviting workers into their homes. A large majority of Greenwoods Arborist Services customers are age 70+ and no longer want to or are able to take care of their gardens themselves, it is important that the customer can see who they are inviting into their homes to make it a more relaxing experience. 

- This section will include a description of each staff member and what they do for the company.

- An image of the staff member is also included so the customers know who to expect.

     - I added the second class into the first as two were not needed.

     - Now looks like: class="form-input text-input"

Retested: Error passed

 ## Deployment

 The site was deployed to GitHub pages.

The steps to deploy are as follows:

- First, I created a new repository by clicking new in the GitHub repository menu
- I used the Code-institute-Org/gitpod-full-template and created a repository name.
- I continued by clicking in the create repository button at the bottom of the page.
- When it had been created I then went to settings.
- Scrolled down to Github pages where it says "Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab! Check it out here!" And I followed the link.
- When on Github pages I selected the source to be the main branch and pressed save.
- A message then pops up that says " Your site is ready to be published at  Your site is published at https://et9719.github.io/GreenwoodAS/" and when clicked on will take you to the site.
